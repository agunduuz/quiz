# 🎓 Let's Take a Quiz! 📝

I have prepared a four-question quiz for you. I'm sure all of you will be successful. Don't forget about the ⏰ time limit!

The languages I used for this project are:

- **🌐 HTML**
- **🎨 CSS**
- **💻 JavaScript**

⌛️ You are running late for the quiz, you can access it from this [link](https://quiz-eight-plum.vercel.app/).

See you in the next project! 👋
